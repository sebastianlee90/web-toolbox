# Number Base Converter Tool

The Number Base Converter Tool lets you instantly convert numbers between binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal formats. It’s designed for developers, students, and anyone who needs to work with different numeral systems in programming, electronics, or mathematics.

## Features

- **Real-time conversion:** Enter a value in any supported base and see all other representations update instantly.
- **Supports all common bases:** Binary (base 2), Octal (base 8), Decimal (base 10), and Hexadecimal (base 16).
- **Bi-directional input:** You can type into any base field, and the others will update automatically.
- **Copy and clear:** Easily copy any converted value or clear all fields with a single click.
- **Input validation:** Alerts you if the value exceeds what can be represented in decimal or if the input is invalid.

## How to Use

1. Enter a number in any of the input fields (binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal).
2. The tool will automatically convert and display the equivalent values in the other bases.
3. Use the copy button next to any field to copy its value.
4. Use the clear button to reset all fields.

## Supported Bases

| Base Name             | Notation | Digits Used | Common Applications                                     |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Binary (Base 2)       | 0, 1     | 0-1         | Computer internal representation, bit operations        |
| Octal (Base 8)        | 0-7      | 0-7         | UNIX file permissions, some programming languages       |
| Decimal (Base 10)     | 0-9      | 0-9         | Everyday calculations, standard numeric representation  |
| Hexadecimal (Base 16) | 0-9, A-F | 0-9, A-F    | Memory addresses, color codes, byte data representation |

## Example

| Binary | Octal | Decimal | Hexadecimal |
| ------ | ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| 101010 | 52    | 42      | 2A          |

If you enter `2A` in the hexadecimal field, the other fields will show `101010`, `52`, and `42` respectively.

## Notes

- The tool ignores invalid characters for each base.
- If the number is too large to be represented accurately in decimal, you’ll see a warning.
- Only integer values are supported.
